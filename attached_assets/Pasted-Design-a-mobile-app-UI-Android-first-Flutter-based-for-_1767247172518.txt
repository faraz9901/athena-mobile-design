Design a mobile app UI (Android-first, Flutter-based) for a construction & tender project management SaaS application.
The app is used by project owners, managers, partners, vendors, and teams to manage the full tender-to-project-closure lifecycle, including documents, expenses, tasks, execution, and reporting.

Design Style Guidelines

Follow Material 3 (Material You) design principles

Clean, professional, enterprise-grade UI

White / light background with subtle accent colors

Card-based layout, clear hierarchy

Mobile-first (single-column)

Consistent app bar, FAB usage, bottom sheets

Icons should be intuitive and minimal
